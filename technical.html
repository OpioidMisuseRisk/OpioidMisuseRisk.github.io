              <p>Our tool was trained on data gathered by The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) during the years 2015-2017.
                NSDUH is a nationwide study providing information on tobacco, alcohol, drug-use, mental health, and other health-related issues
                in the general population of the United States. The study collects data via individual interviews with approximately 70,000 teens
                and adults each year and the results are used to inform various public health programs, policies, and tools; such as our OMR-Tool.
                For more information on the survey, please visit their website:</p>
                  <p><br><a class="btn_2 " href="https://nsduhweb.rti.org/" target = "_blank">NSDUH Website</a></p>

              <p><br>Although NSDUH data set dates back to 1971, using only recent data was a key design consideration, because the opioid crisis has grown and changed
                rapidly in recent years, and it is important for the model to make its predictions based on the current state of the opioid crisis. Additionally, the survey
                underwent a large number of changes starting in 2015, making earlier data difficult to integrate. For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
                Mental Disorders (DSM-V) standards were incorporated into the survey in 2015, changing the diagnostic criteria for many of the included drug and mental health disorders.
                The raw data set contained approximately 170,000 rows, with each row corresponding to a different survey respondent (individual respondents are not allowed to take the
                survey more than once, in the same year or across multiple years). After removing participants who had not used prescription painkillers in the past year, the dataset contained
                approximately <b>53,000 respondents</b>.</p>

  <!-- Feature Selection and pre-processing -->

  <section class="sample-text-area border-top">
    <div class="container box_1170">
      <h3 class="text-heading">Feature Selection and Pre-Processing</h3>
      <p class="sample-text">
The data set contains 2,631 features, each of which corresponds to either a question directly asked on the NSDUH survey,
or a recoded variable created from aggregating multiple questions. The outcome variable for this tool is “Opioid Misuse”,
which is defined as people who answered Yes to the question: <b>“Have you ever, even once, used any prescription pain reliever
in any way a doctor did not direct you to use it in the past 12 months?”</b>  This question is further defined to include using
prescription pain relievers <b>“without a prescription of your own”</b>, <b>“in greater amounts, more often, or longer than you were told
to take it”</b>, or <b>“in any other way a doctor did not direct you to use it."</b></p>

<p><br>Each survey respondent was categorized as having misused or not misused opioids in the past 12 months (from survey date).
For variables that had only categorical responses, we one-hot-encoded them before adding to our model. For variables with a
mix of categorical and continuous responses (e.g., “At what age did you first smoke cigarettes” with a response option for “never smoked”), the
continuous responses were first binned, and then one-hot-encoded along with the categorical responses.</p></br>
<h4> Feature Reduction</h4>
<p>One key challenge was to narrow the feature space down from 2,631 variables in the survey down to roughly 25 variables/questions,
which a patient could practically provide responses for on a form in a physician’s office.  Several strategies for choosing or excluding
features helped achieve this goal:</p>

<p><br><ol class="ordered-list">
  <li><span>Excluding features that were effectively asking the same question as the outcome variable.</span></li>
  <li><span>Excluding features that were very similar to other features in the same topic.</span></li>
  <li><span>Excluding features that only inquired about patient behaviors / activities in the past 30 days, as including
  these would have likely introduced significant look-ahead bias; since the outcome variable measured opioid misuse in the prior 12 months.</span></li>
  <li><span>Choosing feature categories based on what existing research has shown are the most likely contributors to opioid misuse:  patient age, tobacco
  use, other substance abuse (hard drugs), mental health, etc.</span></li>
  <li><span>Choosing features with high differences of misuse prevalence across their response options. Since N-size can be so impactful to this type of calculation, computing the weighted standard deviation of misuse
  prevalence across response options for each question provided an automated and robust way to quickly evaluate each feature.</span></li>
  <li><span>Excluding features from existing research that did not have a strong difference in their prevalence of opioid misuse across response options.</span></li>
  <li><span>Excluding features with perfect or near-perfect correlation with other features, as this multicollinearity could be harmful to both model performance and feature importance accuracy.</span></li>

</ol></p><br>

<h4>Potential Look-Ahead Bias</h4>
<p>Because our outcome variable and certain misuse features for other drugs were specifically about the previous 12 months, the team had to consider the possibility of look-ahead bias; that is,
  for individuals who misused both opioids and another substance in the previous 12 months, which of the misuses came first? Perhaps misusing opioids caused individuals to misuse other substances,
  which would mean misuse of the other drug would be an outcome rather than a feature; this would lead to over-predicting risk for individuals who have used these other substances. However, it could
  also be the other way around, where other substance misuse came first and therefore is a legitimate predictor of opioid misuse; or it could be the underlying predictor of a propensity to misuse opioids
  (e.g., a patient with an “addictive personality”), regardless of which one came first.  </p></br>

  <p>To deal with this potential bias, when possible, the team selected features that encompassed wider time-frames than the 12 month misuse window. This tactic was not always possible, but the direction
    of the look-ahead bias erred on the side of over-predicting risk, which was the more conservative and therefore more tolerable direction of bias. This was one of the main reasons why the team was okay
    allowing a few features with this potential bias.  If this project advances to the clinical trials stage, the team will prioritize eliminating look-ahead bias in a designed experiment.</p></br>

    <p>In conclusion, while there is potentially look-ahead bias, it is by no means definitive, nor is it a detractor of this project’s effectiveness. Given the few features impacted and conservative direction
       of the potential bias, along with the opportunity to eliminate it in future stages, the team accepted this risk but also felt it was important to acknowledge.</p></br>
