                        <h2>What Are Opioids?</h2>
                        <p>Opioids are a class of drugs that include prescription medications like hydrocodone (Vicodin), oxycodone (OxyContin),
                          codeine, and morphine. Also falling under this class are powerful synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, and street narcotics like heroin.
                          Opioids are typically prescribed as pain relievers, and are generally safe if taken in short duration and as prescribed.
                          Longer use, such as for chronic pain or when taken recreationally, can lead to tolerance and dependence, and high doses can
                          lead to overdose.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-9">
              <p>Over the past decade, rates of opioid dependence and overdose have risen to an all-time high.
                In 2017, more than 47,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses--an average of over 130 people per day.
                It is estimated that prescription opioid misuse costs the United States $78.5 billion a year in lost productivity, health care,
                addiction treatment, and criminal justice. In 2017, the president declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency.</p>
              <img src="img/crisis_by_numbers.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <p><br>Many opioid addictions begin with prescription painkillers. Approximately 21-29% of chronic pain patients misuse
              their prescription opioids, and 80% of people who use heroin first misuse prescription opioids.
              Of those who misuse prescription opioids, 53% were taking medication prescribed for a family member or friend.</p>
              <br><br>
              <h3>How Did It Begin?</h3>
              <p>While the opioid crisis exists due to a variety of sociopolitical factors, one major contributor was the prescription
                  drug companies that manufacture the medications. In the 1990’s, pharmaceutical companies marketed prescription opioids
                  as non-addictive and safe for long-term use. This led to mass overprescription of opioids by physicians; reliance on the
                  drugs, paired with the rising costs of the medication, contributed to a raging black market for prescription and street opioids.
                  80% of all opioid prescriptions are written in the U.S., and every year, enough opioid prescriptions are written for each U.S. adult
                  to get one. </p>
